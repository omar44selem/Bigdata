                Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise
                deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing
                application software. Data with many fields (columns) offer greater statistical power, while data with
                higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data
                analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer,
                visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally
                associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents
                challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Therefore, big
                data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within
                an acceptable time and value.

                Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior
                analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom
                to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are
                indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."[4] Analysis
                of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so
                on".[5] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners,
                advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including
                Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and
                business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology,
                genomics,[6] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[7]

                The size and number of available data sets has grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as
                mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote
                sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and
                wireless sensor networks.[8][9] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has
                roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[10] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5Ã—260 bytes)
                of data are generated.[11] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to
                grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts
                there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[12] One question for large enterprises is determining who should
                own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[13]

                Relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data
                often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may
                require "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers".[14] What
                qualifies as "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools.
                Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. "For some organizations, facing
                hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management
                options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant
                consideration.

                Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG,
                Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, and Dell have spent more than $15 billion on software
                firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100
                billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a
                whole.[5]

                Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6 billion mobile-phone
                subscriptions worldwide, and between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet.[5] Between
                1990 and 2005, more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people
                became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to
                exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in
                1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 exabytes in 2007[10] and predictions put the amount of internet traffic
                at 667 exabytes annually by 2014.[5] According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored
                information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,[53] which is the format most
                useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the
                form of video and audio content).

                While many vendors offer off-the-shelf solutions for big data, experts recommend the development of
                in-house solutions custom-tailored to solve the company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient
                technical capabilities.The use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows
                efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation,[55] but does not come without its flaws.
                Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government (central and local) to work in collaboration
                and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome. A common government organization
                that makes use of big data is the National Security Administration (NSA), who monitor the activities of
                the Internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their
                system may pick up.

                Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) collects all certificates status from birth to death.
                CRVS is a source of big data for governments.

                To understand how the media uses big data, it is first necessary to provide some context into the
                mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that
                practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about
                millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using
                specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead taps into
                consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The
                ultimate aim is to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with
                the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages
                (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned
                through various data-mining activities.[84]

                Data capture
                Data journalism: publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights
                and infographics.

                data analysis.

                Especially since 2015, big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help
                employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology
                (IT). The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT
                operations analytics (ITOA).[92] By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine
                intelligence and deep computing, IT departments can predict potential issues and move to provide
                solutions before the problems even happen.[92] In this time, ITOA businesses were also beginning to play
                a major role in systems management by offering platforms that brought individual data silos together and
                generated insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data.
